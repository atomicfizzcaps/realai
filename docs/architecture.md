## 1. Executive Summary

RealAI is an AI provider platform designed to orchestrate multiple LLM providers—OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI/Grok, Mistral, and local models—through a single, unified engine. The long-term objective is to train and deploy proprietary model weights (`realai-1.0`, `realai-overseer`) to operate as a fully standalone AI provider.

The architecture is fully modular. Every component—engine pillar, provider adapter, tool handler, model entry—is pluggable, replaceable, and independently testable. There are no hard dependencies between modules. Swap a provider, add a tool, change a routing rule—nothing else breaks.

### Design Principle

Every component exports a standard interface. Every module can be tested in isolation. No module reaches into another module's internals. Configuration drives behavior—not code changes.

Core capabilities at maturity:

- Unified API for multi-provider LLM access (chat, completion, embedding, streaming)
- Intelligent routing across providers based on cost, speed, capability, and availability
- Persistent agent memory (session-scoped and long-term)
- Declarative agent definitions with tool access and model preferences
- Full observability: structured logging, metrics, cost tracking
- Proprietary model training and deployment pipeline

## 2. Engine Core — The 5 Pillars

The engine is composed of five core modules. Each pillar is a standalone unit with a defined responsibility, a single entry point, and a clean interface boundary. Together, they form the runtime backbone of RealAI.

| Pillar | Responsibility | Entry Point | Dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Loader | Bootstrap, config validation, registration | `engine/loader.js` | None (runs first) |
| Executor | Task orchestration, prompt execution, retries | `engine/executor.js` | Router, Memory, Logger |
| Router | Provider + model selection, fallback chains | `engine/router.js` | Capabilities Graph, Model Registry |
| Memory | Session context, persistent storage, retrieval | `engine/memory.js` | Logger |
| Logger | Structured logging, metrics, observability | `engine/logger.js` | None (standalone) |

### 2.1 Loader

The Loader is the bootstrap sequence. It runs once at startup, before any request is accepted. Its job is to read all configuration, validate it, and register every provider, model, tool, and agent so the rest of the engine can operate on a known-good state.

Responsibilities:

- Read and parse `config/metadata.json` (master config)
- Load and validate provider configurations (API keys present, endpoints reachable)
- Load `registry/models.json` and `registry/capabilities.json`
- Load and validate tool manifests from `registry/tools.json`
- Load agent manifests from `agents/*.yaml` and map them to available capabilities
- Run health checks on all enabled providers
- Emit startup diagnostics to Logger (what loaded, what failed, what was skipped)

Output: A fully hydrated engine context object containing all validated registries, ready to pass to the Executor.

> **Implementation Note**
>
> The Loader should fail fast and loud. If a required config file is missing or a critical provider key is absent, the engine should refuse to start—not silently degrade.

### 2.2 Executor

The Executor is the runtime brain. It receives a task or prompt, determines how to handle it, and orchestrates the full execution lifecycle.

Responsibilities:

- Receive incoming task/prompt with metadata (user ID, agent ID, preferences)
- Call the Router to resolve the optimal provider + model combination
- Format the prompt according to the selected provider's expected schema
- Manage token budgets (truncate context if needed to fit within model limits)
- Execute the request via the appropriate provider adapter
- Handle retry logic with exponential backoff on transient failures
- Manage fallback chains: if primary provider fails, route to secondary
- Support synchronous and streaming response modes
- Handle multi-step agent workflows (chain-of-thought, tool-use loops, iterative refinement)
- Write request/response to Memory and Logger

Execution flow:

1. Receive request
2. Load agent context from Memory
3. Query Router for provider/model
4. Format prompt
5. Call adapter
6. Process response (handle tool calls if any)
7. Return result
8. Update Memory
9. Log everything

### 2.3 Router

The Router is the intelligence layer for provider and model selection. It does not execute requests—it decides where requests go.

Responsibilities:

- Score available models against the incoming request's requirements
- Route based on: task type, model capabilities, cost, latency, availability, user preference
- Support priority rules (e.g., “always prefer Claude for code tasks”)
- Support fallback chains (primary → secondary → tertiary)
- Read from the Capabilities Graph to make informed scoring decisions
- Respect provider health status (skip providers that are down or rate-limited)
- Load balancing across providers when multiple are equally scored

See [Section 3](#3-provider-router--deep-dive) for the deep dive on routing logic.

### 2.4 Memory

The Memory module provides persistent and session-scoped storage for agents and users.

| Tier | Description | Persistence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Short-term | Conversation context within a single session. Message history, tool call results, intermediate state. | Session lifetime | Build now |
| Long-term | Stored facts, user preferences, project context. Persisted to disk or database. | Permanent | Build now |
| Vector | Embeddings-based retrieval for semantic search over past interactions and documents. | Permanent | Future (Phase 3) |

> **Critical Rule**
>
> Memory is scoped per agent and per user. No cross-contamination. Agent A cannot read Agent B's memory. User X's data never leaks to User Y. Enforce at the storage layer, not just the application layer.

### 2.5 Logger

The Logger is the centralized observability layer. Every meaningful event in the engine passes through it.

What gets logged:

- Every incoming request (timestamp, user ID, agent ID, prompt hash)
- Every routing decision (which provider/model was selected and why)
- Every provider response (latency, token count, status code)
- Every error (type, provider, retry count, resolution)
- Every tool call (tool name, input summary, execution time, result status)

Log format: Structured JSON. Every log entry is a valid JSON object with standardized fields: `timestamp`, `level`, `module`, `event`, `data`.

Log levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`

Future: Integration with Grafana, Datadog, or custom admin dashboard for real-time monitoring and alerting.

## 3. Provider Router — Deep Dive

The Router is the decision engine that determines the optimal provider + model for every request. This section details the scoring algorithm, health management, and configuration format.

### 3.1 Scoring Algorithm

When a request arrives, the Router scores every eligible model across multiple dimensions. The model with the highest composite score wins.

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Capability Match | 40% | How well the model's capabilities align with the task type. Sourced from Capabilities Graph. |
| Cost Efficiency | 20% | Estimated cost for this request based on input/output token pricing from Model Registry. |
| Speed / Latency | 15% | Historical and expected latency. Streaming requests may weight this higher. |
| Availability | 15% | Provider health status, current rate limit headroom, recent error rate. |
| User Preference | 10% | Explicit user or agent-level overrides. |

Composite score formula:

```text
score = (capability_match * 0.40)
      + (cost_score * 0.20)
      + (speed_score * 0.15)
      + (availability_score * 0.15)
      + (preference_score * 0.10)
```

### 3.2 Circuit Breaker Pattern

Each provider has a circuit breaker with three states:

- **CLOSED (healthy)** — Requests flow normally. Errors are counted.
- **OPEN (tripped)** — Provider is skipped entirely. No requests sent. Checked periodically.
- **HALF-OPEN (testing)** — A single test request is sent. If it succeeds, circuit closes. If it fails, circuit re-opens.

Trip thresholds: 5 consecutive failures OR error rate > 50% in a 60-second window.
Recovery probe interval: 30 seconds.

### 3.3 Routing Configuration Format

Routing rules are defined in JSON and loaded at startup:

```json
{
  "routing_rules": [
    {
      "task_type": "code_generation",
      "preferred_models": ["claude-3.5-sonnet", "gpt-4o", "codestral"],
      "fallback_chain": ["gpt-4o", "grok-3", "mistral-large"],
      "max_cost_per_request": 0.50,
      "require_capabilities": ["code-gen", "function-calling"]
    },
    {
      "task_type": "creative_writing",
      "preferred_models": ["claude-3.5-sonnet", "gpt-4o"],
      "fallback_chain": ["grok-3"],
      "require_capabilities": ["creative"]
    },
    {
      "task_type": "default",
      "preferred_models": ["gpt-4o"],
      "fallback_chain": ["claude-3.5-sonnet", "grok-3"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3.4 Example Routing Scenario

**Scenario: Code Generation Request**

1. User sends a code generation prompt to the Executor.
2. Executor calls Router with `task_type: code_generation`.
3. Router loads the `code_generation` routing rule.
4. Router checks Capabilities Graph → `claude-3.5-sonnet` has highest `code_gen` score.
5. Router checks circuit breaker for Anthropic → `CLOSED` (healthy).
6. Router returns: `{ provider: "anthropic", model: "claude-3.5-sonnet" }`.
7. If Anthropic returns 429: Router marks it HALF-OPEN, re-routes to `gpt-4o` via fallback chain.
8. Executor retries with OpenAI adapter transparently. User sees no interruption.

## 4. Provider Adapters

Each external LLM provider gets a dedicated adapter module. Adapters normalize the provider's proprietary API into RealAI's internal schema (OpenAI-compatible format). The rest of the engine never interacts with provider APIs directly—only through adapters.

### 4.1 Adapter Responsibilities

- Authentication: Manage API keys, tokens, and auth headers per provider
- Request formatting: Transform RealAI's internal request format into the provider's expected schema
- Response normalization: Transform provider-specific responses into RealAI's standard response format
- Error translation: Map provider error codes/messages to RealAI's internal error taxonomy
- Streaming support: Handle SSE/chunked responses and emit normalized stream events
- Health checks: Expose a `healthCheck()` method the Loader and Router can call

### 4.2 Standard Adapter Interface

Every adapter must export this interface:

```json
{
  "chat": "chat(messages, options)",
  "complete": "complete(prompt, options)",
  "embed": "embed(input, options)",
  "stream": "stream(messages, options)",
  "healthCheck": "Returns { status, latency, provider }"
}
```

### 4.3 Adapter Inventory

| Adapter File | Provider | Models Covered | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `adapters/openai.js` | OpenAI | GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, o1, o3 | Build Phase 1 |
| `adapters/anthropic.js` | Anthropic | Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 4, Opus | Build Phase 1 |
| `adapters/xai.js` | xAI | Grok-2, Grok-3 | Build Phase 2 |
| `adapters/mistral.js` | Mistral | Mistral Large, Codestral | Build Phase 2 |
| `adapters/local.js` | Local / Self-hosted | Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp | Build Phase 2 |
| `adapters/realai.js` | RealAI (proprietary) | `realai-1.0`, `realai-overseer` | Build Phase 4 |

## 5. Tool Registry

The Tool Registry is the central catalog of all tools (functions) available to agents. Tools extend an agent's capabilities beyond text generation—enabling web search, file operations, code execution, API calls, and more.

### 5.1 Architecture

- Registry file: `registry/tools.json` — JSON manifest of all registered tools
- Handler directory: `tools/` — Actual implementation files
- Validation: The Loader validates all tool schemas at startup (JSON Schema format)
- Scoping: Tools can be global (all agents) or agent-specific (declared in agent manifest)
- Sandboxing: Tool execution is sandboxed—tools cannot access engine internals or other tools' state

### 5.2 Tool Manifest Format

```json
{
  "name": "web_search",
  "description": "Search the web for current information",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "query": { "type": "string", "description": "Search query" },
      "max_results": { "type": "integer", "default": 5 }
    },
    "required": ["query"]
  },
  "handler": "tools/web_search.js",
  "scope": "global",
  "timeout_ms": 10000
}
```

### 5.3 Core Tools (Phase 1)

| Tool Name | Handler | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `web_search` | `tools/web_search.js` | Search the web for current information |
| `file_read` | `tools/file_ops.js` | Read contents of a file |
| `file_write` | `tools/file_ops.js` | Write content to a file |
| `code_execute` | `tools/code_execute.js` | Execute code in a sandboxed environment |
| `api_call` | `tools/api_call.js` | Make HTTP requests to external APIs |
| `database_query` | `tools/db_query.js` | Run queries against connected databases |
| `blockchain_read` | `tools/blockchain.js` | Read data from Solana or other chains |

Future: Dynamic tool loading at runtime, community tool marketplace, and a tool SDK for third-party developers.

## 6. Model Registry

The Model Registry is the single source of truth for every model available across all providers. The Router reads from this registry to understand what's available, what each model costs, and what it can do.

Registry file: `registry/models.json`

### 6.1 Model Entry Schema

```json
{
  "id": "gpt-4o",
  "provider": "openai",
  "context_window": 128000,
  "max_output": 16384,
  "modalities": ["text", "vision", "code"],
  "cost_input": 2.50,
  "cost_output": 10.00,
  "capabilities": ["reasoning", "code-gen", "vision", "function-calling"],
  "status": "active"
}
```

### 6.2 Initial Model Catalog

| Model ID | Provider | Context | Modalities | Cost In/Out ($/M tok) | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gpt-4o` | OpenAI | 128K | text, vision, code | $2.50 / $10.00 | Active |
| `gpt-4-turbo` | OpenAI | 128K | text, vision, code | $10.00 / $30.00 | Active |
| `o1` | OpenAI | 200K | text, code | $15.00 / $60.00 | Active |
| `claude-3.5-sonnet` | Anthropic | 200K | text, vision, code | $3.00 / $15.00 | Active |
| `claude-4-opus` | Anthropic | 200K | text, vision, code | $15.00 / $75.00 | Active |
| `grok-3` | xAI | 131K | text, code | $3.00 / $15.00 | Active |
| `mistral-large` | Mistral | 128K | text, code | $2.00 / $6.00 | Active |
| `codestral` | Mistral | 32K | code | $0.30 / $0.90 | Active |
| `realai-1.0` | RealAI | TBD | TBD | TBD | Planned |
| `realai-overseer` | RealAI | TBD | TBD | TBD | Planned |

Status values: `active`, `inactive`, `deprecated`, `planned`.

Future: Auto-discovery of new models via provider APIs, automatic cost updates, deprecation alerts.

## 7. metadata.json — The Master Config

This is the root configuration file. It ties every component together and controls the engine's behavior. Located at `config/metadata.json`.

### 7.1 Full Structure

```json
{
  "engine_version": "0.1.0",
  "engine_name": "realai-engine",
  "default_provider": "openai",

    },
    "local": {

      "timeout_ms": 60000
    }
  },
  "features": {
    "streaming": true,

    "short_term_max_messages": 50,
    "long_term_backend": "file",
    "long_term_path": "data/memory/"
  }
}
```

> **Security Rule**
>
> API keys are never stored in `metadata.json`. Only environment variable names are referenced. The Loader reads the actual key from the environment at runtime. If the env var is missing, the provider is disabled with a warning.

## 8. Capabilities Graph

The Capabilities Graph is a structured scoring matrix that maps what each model can do and how well it does it. The Router consults this graph to make intelligent model selection decisions.

File: `registry/capabilities.json`

### 8.1 Scoring Dimensions

Each model is scored 0–100 on each dimension. Scores represent relative capability compared to the current state-of-the-art.

| Dimension | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `reasoning` | Complex multi-step logical reasoning, analysis, problem solving |
| `code_gen` | Code generation, debugging, refactoring, multi-language support |
| `creative` | Creative writing, storytelling, nuance, tone control |
| `vision` | Image understanding, OCR, visual analysis |
| `function_calling` | Structured tool use, JSON output reliability, schema adherence |
| `math` | Mathematical computation, symbolic reasoning, proofs |
| `multilingual` | Quality across non-English languages |
| `speed` | Tokens per second, time to first token |
| `cost_efficiency` | Quality-to-cost ratio |

### 8.2 Current Scores

| Model | Reason | Code | Creative | Vision | Fn Call | Math | Speed | Cost Eff. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gpt-4o` | 92 | 90 | 85 | 88 | 95 | 88 | 80 | 60 |
| `claude-3.5-sonnet` | 90 | 93 | 92 | 85 | 88 | 85 | 75 | 65 |
| `claude-4-opus` | 96 | 95 | 95 | 90 | 92 | 93 | 60 | 30 |
| `grok-3` | 85 | 80 | 78 | 0 | 70 | 82 | 90 | 75 |
| `mistral-large` | 82 | 78 | 75 | 0 | 80 | 78 | 85 | 80 |
| `codestral` | 60 | 88 | 30 | 0 | 75 | 70 | 92 | 95 |
| `o1` | 98 | 92 | 70 | 0 | 60 | 97 | 30 | 20 |

Extensibility: Custom dimensions can be added (e.g. `agent_orchestration`, `safety`, `instruction_following`). The Router dynamically reads whatever dimensions are present and weights them based on task requirements.

Future: Automated benchmarking pipeline that re-scores models on a regular cadence against standardized eval suites, keeping the graph current without manual updates.

## 9. Missing Pieces — The 12 Items

The following components are identified as missing or not yet built. Each is categorized by priority level. This is the gap analysis—everything below needs to be built for RealAI to reach production readiness.

| # | Component | Priority | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Authentication & API Key Management | CRITICAL | Secure vault or env-based key rotation system for all provider keys. Support for multiple key pools per provider to distribute rate limits. |
| 2 | Rate Limiting & Quota Management | CRITICAL | Per-provider and per-user rate limit tracking to avoid 429 errors. Token-bucket or sliding-window algorithms. Budget caps per user/agent. |
| 3 | Error Recovery & Retry Logic | HIGH | Standardized retry with exponential backoff and jitter. Circuit breakers per provider. Graceful degradation on total provider failure. |
| 4 | Streaming Infrastructure | HIGH | SSE or WebSocket layer for real-time token streaming to clients. Adapter-level stream normalization. |
| 5 | Agent Manifest System | HIGH | Declarative YAML/JSON files defining each agent's system prompt, personality, available tools, model preferences, memory scope, and behavioral constraints. |
| 6 | User Session Management | HIGH | Session creation, unique session IDs, context persistence across conversation turns, session timeout and cleanup. |
| 7 | Vector Store Integration | MEDIUM | Embeddings database for semantic memory and RAG-style retrieval over past interactions. |
| 8 | Fine-Tuning Pipeline | MEDIUM | Infrastructure for fine-tuning open-weight models on custom datasets. Version management, evaluation hooks, deployment to inference. |
| 9 | Evaluation & Benchmarking Suite | MEDIUM | Automated testing of model outputs against quality benchmarks. Feeds updated scores back to Capabilities Graph. |
| 10 | Admin Dashboard | MEDIUM | Web UI for monitoring provider health, real-time costs, usage stats, routing decision logs, and system diagnostics. |
| 11 | Plugin / Extension System | MEDIUM | Architecture for third-party or community-built plugins, custom tools, new adapters, and agent templates. |
| 12 | Billing & Usage Tracking | MEDIUM | Cost tracking per user, per agent, per provider. Budget alerts, spend dashboards, and usage reports. |

**RealAI Architecture Blueprint — Version 0.1.0**

Prepared by Travis | May 7, 2026 | Henderson, NV

This document is the implementation reference for RealAI. Every section is designed to be handed directly to an implementing agent or developer. Build modular. Build clean. Ship working software.
